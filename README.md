The project was focused on the estimation of the Lyapunov exponent from a single time series. A central point is to apply the technique for space reconstruction (attractor reconstruction) and then apply the algorithm of Rosenstein et al. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016727899390009P) to compute the largest Lyapunov exponent. 

Moreover, I tried to adjust the algorithm of Rosenstein et al. in order to increase the level of reproducibility. The approach I proposed is quite a mess, but during the exam the professor suggested a simpler way to address this issue.

Additional comments:
- the code is a really confused.
- The slides contain some mistakes!
- In the slides you can find the information to build a pseudo-algorithm, but unfortunatly in italian.
